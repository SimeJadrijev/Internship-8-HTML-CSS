                Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible.
                But here we are. I'm trying my best.

                The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a
                <span>role="presentation"</span> attribute to make decorated sections without css.
                If you view source on the page, you'll see that there are a LOT of
                tables. The table tag typically is used to display tabular data and
                should NOT be used as a layout method. However, since I am not allowed
                to use CSS, I am pretty much exclusively relying on tables for this
                purpose. The presentation role tells the browser to not expose the
                table and its tabluar children in the accessibility tree. This will
                make it easier to navigate for assistive technology. 
                <br> <br>
                I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements from HTML 3.2 that you should
                never use. In order to be "compliant", I've added the HTML 3.2 doctype
                at the top of the page:
                <span> &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt; </span>
                This helps give a hint to the browser that we are going to use some
                older stuff.
                <br> <br>
                HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as
                <span>details/summary, section, main, header,</span> and <span>footer</span>. So I'm just making
                a mess of my doctype and what I should be actually using!
